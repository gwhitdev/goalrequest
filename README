This program makes two GET requests to an HackerRank API for a given football team name. It then makes as extra requests to total up the number of goals the team scored when they are either listed as 'team1' or 'team2'. 
The program then returns the total number of goals and writes the result of the data from the original responses to two JSON files in the local folder.

Uses: Javascript promises, async/await.
